    <h1>🥐Croissant🥐</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian
        kipferl but
        using
        the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough
        is
        layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
        technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
        <br />
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity
        but using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The
        modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the
        kipferl with ayeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
        preformed but unbaked dough
        made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
        Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants
        sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
        <br />
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
